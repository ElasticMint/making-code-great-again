# Making Code Great Again

This project shows the code for a sample project before and after a code review focussing on coding style and how we ensure our code is maintainable for the next person who has to work in it.

Originally developed for a tech talk for one of our clients, the code draws on a lot of the ideas promoted by Kevlin Henney.

It covers things like:
 
* Structuring code by the functionality it supports rather than object type
* Adding useful logging to help with resolving issues and dynamically changing the logging level
* Using a Resharper settings file to define a style that can be easily verified
* Naming classes well 
* Aligning parameters for readability
